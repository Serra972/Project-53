   <p> React is a JavaScript library created for building fast and interactive user interfaces for web and mobile applications. It is an open-source, component-based, front-end library responsible only for the applicationâ€™s view layer. In Model View Controller (MVC) architecture, the view layer is responsible for how the app looks and feels. It is the most popular front-end JavaScript library in the field of web development. It is used by large, established companies and newly-minted startups alike (Netflix, Airbnb, Instagram, and the New York Times, to name a few). React brings many advantages to the table, making it a better choice than other frameworks like Angular.js.</p>

   <p> JavaScript is an interpreted client-side scripting language that allows a web designer the ability to insert code into their web page. JavaScript is commonly placed into an HTML or ASP file and runs directly from the web page and today is the most popular programming language. JavaScript can be used to perform more advanced tasks such as printing the time and date, creating a calendar, or other tasks that are not possible in HTML.</p>
